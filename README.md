# Running the Project in Google Colab

This guide provides instructions for running the code in this repository using Google Colab. Follow the steps below to set up the environment, upload data files, and run the provided Python scripts.

## Setting Up the Environment in Google Colab

1. Open Google Colab in your browser: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Create a new notebook by clicking on `File` > `New Notebook`.

## Installing Necessary Python Packages

In the first cell of your Colab notebook, install the required Python packages by running the following command:

```python
!pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn geopandas requests
```

## Uploading Data Files to Google Colab

To upload the necessary data files to your Colab environment, follow these steps:

1. Click on the folder icon on the left sidebar to open the file explorer.
2. Click on the upload icon and select the data files (`clean_data.csv`, `gadm41_TWN_2.json`, etc.) from your local machine.

Alternatively, you can use the following code snippet to upload files directly from your local machine:

```python
from google.colab import files

uploaded = files.upload()
```

## Running the Provided Python Scripts

### Running `clean.py`

1. Upload the `clean.py` script to your Colab environment.
2. In a new cell, run the following code to execute the script:

```python
!python clean.py
```

### Running `maps2.py`

1. Upload the `maps2.py` script to your Colab environment.
2. In a new cell, run the following code to execute the script:

```python
!python maps2.py
```

### Running `plots.py`

1. Upload the `plots.py` script to your Colab environment.
2. In a new cell, run the following code to execute the script:

```python
!python plots.py
```

## Accessing Visualization Outputs

The visualization outputs generated by the scripts will be saved in the `plots` directory. You can download the generated plots by clicking on the file names in the file explorer on the left sidebar.

That's it! You are now ready to run the project in Google Colab. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to open an issue in this repository.
